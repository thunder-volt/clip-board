- [2025-09-29 07:01:31] Optional Improvements

Add timestamps for each clipboard entry.

Skip duplicates if needed.

Automatically format as bullet points or sections.
- [2025-09-29 07:02:27] If you want, I can give a fully polished version that:

Adds timestamps

Skips duplicates

Works cross-platform

This will make your GitHub Markdown log look neat and readable.

Do you want me to do that?
