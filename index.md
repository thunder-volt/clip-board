- [2025-10-11 22:02:06] You are given an undirected connected weighted graph of n nodes which contains no cycles. For q different pairs of nodes, we would like you to find the maximum flow from the first node in the pair to the second node in the pair. See the definition for max flow below if you don't know what it means.

Also, please answer these queries online. Originally, I was going to force you to do this by encrypting stuff, but that would make this problem harder to read and more annoying. So, on your honor, please answer the first query before reading the second query, et cetera. After all, this is just practice for you to get better, right?

The maximum flow in a graph between two nodes a
and b can be defined as follows: You may pick any path from a to b such that every edge on that path has a positive weight. Then you may subtract 1 from the weight of every edge on that path, and add 1 to your answer. Keep doing this as many times as you would like. The "maximum flow" between the two nodes is the greatest that your answer could possibly be, if you choose your paths optimally at every step.
